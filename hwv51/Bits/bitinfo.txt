*** Information About Bit Files ***
  It is useful to keep around 13 core bit files of different builds. 
  This file describes features of .bit files checked into the repository.

*** risc13_notrain_v1.bit ***
  -- New ring architecture (no train)

*** risc13_coherentL1_v1.bit ***
  -- New ring architecture
  -- Coherent caches. L1 caches only (no L2 cache simulation)
  
*** risc13_coherentL1_v2.bit ***
  -- New ring architecture
  -- Coherent caches. L1 caches only (no L2 cache simulation)
  -- DMC Cache Push supported
  
*** risc13_coherentL1_v3.bit ***
  -- New ring architecture
  -- Coherent caches. L1 caches only (no L2 cache simulation), added delay
     of 1000 cycles per L1 cache miss.
  -- DMC Cache Push supported

*** risc13_2wayICache.bit ***
  -- New ring architecture
  -- Coherent caches. L1 caches only (no L2 cache simulation), added delay
     of 1000 cycles per L1 cache miss.
  -- Metering support for DMisses and IMisses
  -- 2 Way set associative ICache
